Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.\n","- **Balance:** also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.\n","- **NumOfProducts:** refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.\n","- **HasCrCard:** denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.\n","- **IsActiveMember:** active customers are less likely to leave the bank.\n","- **EstimatedSalary:** as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.\n","- **Exited:** whether or not the customer left the bank.
